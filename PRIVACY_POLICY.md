# Privacy Policy for MeetMindr (Chrome Extension)

Effective Date: 30 Oct 2025
Last Updated: 30 Oct 2025

## 🧠 Introduction

MeetMindr (“the Extension”, “we”, “our”, “us”) is a Chrome extension that helps users record and analyze Google Meet sessions using AI to generate summaries, action items, and key decisions.

We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and how you can control it.

## 🔐 Information We Collect

1. Audio Recordings (User-Initiated)

MeetMindr captures meeting audio only when the user manually starts recording within the extension.

The captured audio is securely sent to Google Cloud for AI-based analysis and summary generation.

Recordings are not stored permanently on our servers.

2. User Email (Optional / For Usage Limits)

We may use the user’s Google account email (via Chrome Identity API) to:

Enforce fair usage limits (e.g., 3 recordings per week).

Associate recordings with the correct user account.

This information is not shared, sold, or used for marketing.

3. Extension Preferences

We use local storage to save:

Recording preferences.

Meeting history summaries.

Remaining quota (number of recordings left per week).

These are stored locally on your device, not sent externally.

4. Anonymous Usage Data (Optional)

We may collect minimal, aggregated, non-identifiable analytics (e.g., total number of meetings processed) to improve performance and user experience.

No personal or meeting content is ever collected.

## 🧰 How We Use Your Data

Your data is used strictly for the following purposes:

To provide AI-based meeting analysis.

To deliver notifications (e.g., when your summary is ready).

To enforce fair usage and prevent misuse.

To maintain reliable extension performance.

We never use or share your data for advertising, profiling, or reselling.

## ☁️ Data Processing & Security

Audio is processed securely via Google Cloud Functions and analyzed using Gemini 2.5 Pro.

All transmission occurs over HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for end-to-end encryption.

No data is stored beyond the duration required for processing.

## 👤 Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or rent users’ personal information.
Data may be shared only with:

Google Cloud Services, for AI processing.

Chrome Identity Services, for authentication.

No other third-party access is permitted.

## 🗑️ Data Retention & Deletion

Temporary audio files are deleted automatically after AI processing (usually within minutes).

Users can manually delete summaries and data stored locally at any time.

We do not retain identifiable data after processing is complete.

## 🔄 User Control

You can:

Delete local data anytime via Chrome’s “Clear Data” tools.

Revoke access through your Google Account Permissions.

Uninstall the extension to immediately stop any further data collection.
